<body>
<hi> I am glad to share my Code Plateau & nHub experience here. </hi>


	As regard learning; the little IT knowledge i had prior to the training was improved on, I got to know more about what a computer is, softwares and types of softwares, operating systems, programming and programing languages,the internet, data processing, algorithm (smile) sir Afe. as well as algorithm flow chat and command line, VCS and DVCs git and github to be precised.

Regarding Socializing; i met new people, i am getting more and more with my tutors and colleagues by the day, met and made new friends as a result, i can say i have a clique.

Regarding Emotions(smiling); i think i already have a crush....

Concluding, every new experience comes with its challenging, mine are there, a times stressful and yet very very interesting all the time. Thank you for the experience worthwhile.
